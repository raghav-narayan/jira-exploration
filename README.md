# JIRA Exploration Assignment  

## Project Overview  
This project provides hands-on experience with **JIRA**, a leading Agile project management tool, by simulating the development of a **Student Management System (SMS)**. The SMS helps schools manage student records, course enrollment, attendance, and grades. The project follows Agile principles, leveraging JIRA features such as Kanban boards, user stories, sprints, task assignments, and report generation.

## Key Features  

### JIRA Implementation Highlights  
1. **User Stories**:  
   - Defined key functionalities of the SMS, including student registration, course enrollment, attendance tracking, grade submission, and academic performance viewing.  

2. **Task and Sub-task Management**:  
   - User stories were broken down into smaller tasks (e.g., database schema design, frontend UI development, and API integration).  

3. **Kanban Board**:  
   - Visualized task progress with stages: *To Do*, *In Progress*, and *Done*.  

4. **Sprint Planning**:  
   - Created two one-week sprints for Scrum projects to prioritize and execute tasks efficiently.  

5. **Bug Tracking and Reporting**:  
   - Used JIRA to log and resolve production bugs.  
   - Generated reports such as cumulative flow diagrams and burndown charts for progress visualization.
